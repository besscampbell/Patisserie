# Pierre's Patisserie

#### Friday Project for Epicodus using a Many-to-Many and User Authentication , 1.15.2020

#### By Bess Campbell 

## Description

Pierre is back! He wants you to create a new application to market his sweet and savory treats. This time, he would like you to build an application with user authentication and a many-to-many relationship. Here are the features he wants in the application:

The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality. All users should be able to have read functionality.
There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

• A browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

• A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

• With [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer) installed

• [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) **Instructions for setup below**

• [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391) **Instructions for setup below**

#### MySQL & MySQL Workbench Setup instructions

* Download the [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914). Click the 'No thanks, just start my download' link.
* Follow along with the installer until you reach the Configuration page. Then select the following options:
  * Use Legacy Password Encryption.
  * Set password to **epicodus** or to your own personlized password.
  * Click Finish.

* Open the terminal and enter the command `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql//bin:$PATH"'>>~/.bash_profile`
* Type `source ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal to verify that MySQL was installed.
* Enter `mysql -uroot -pepicodus` or `mysql -uroot -p{your_password}` in the terminal to verify the installation. You will know it's installed when you gain access to the `mysql>` command line.
* Download the [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391) file using the 'No thanks, just start my download' link.
* Install MySQL Workbench in the Applications folder.
* Open MySQL Workbench and select the `Local instance 3306` server. You will need to enter the password **epicodus** (or the password you set). 

#### Setup and Use (cloning)

 * Open your terminal and ensure you are within the directory you'd like the file to be created in.
 * Enter the following command `$ git clone https://github.com/besscampbell/Patisserie.git`
 * Once cloned, use the `$ cd Patisserie.Solution/Patisserie` command to navigate to the project directory.
 * Enter `$ dotnet restore`

#### Import database with Entity Framework Core
* Now enter `$ dotnet ef database update` to create database in MySQL.
* To run the console application, enter `$ dotnet run`
* Your command line will open a server (likely `http://localhost:5000/`). Navigate to this URL in your browser to view the project.

#### Import Database with MySQL Workbench
* In the top toolbar of MySQL Workbench, click on `Server -> Data Import`.
* Select option for `Import from Self-Contained File`.
* Set the `Default Target Schema` or create a new schema.
* Select Schema Objects you wish to import.
* Ensure the option `Dump Structure and Data` is selected (located near the bottom).
* Click `Start Import`

#### Import Database with SQL Schema
* Open MySql Workbench and paste the following Schema Create Statement into a new SQL tab for executing queries.

```


```
